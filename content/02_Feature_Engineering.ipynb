    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't yet see the [overview posting] for this series, please take a minute to read that first...  Are you back?  Great.  Let's dive in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is going to delve into the mechanics of _feature engineering_ for the sorts of time series data that you may use as part of a stock price prediction modeling system.  I'll cover the basic concept, then offer some useful python code \"recipes\" for transforming your raw source data into features which can be fed directly into a ML algorithm or ML pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe (and I don't think I'm alone) that featue engineering is the most under-appreciated part of the art of machine learning.  It's certainly the most time consuming and tedious, but it's creative and \"fun\" (for those who like getting their hands dirty with data, anyway...).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is also one of the key areas where those with domain expertise can shine.  Those whose expertise in investing is greater than their skill in machine learning will find that feature engineering will allow them to express that expertise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is particularly important to making stock predictions.  All too often, I come across an online tutorial on forecasting stock prices which simply feed in daily returns (or worse, daily prices!) into a mind-blowingly complex algorithm and conclude that machine learning does not work for price prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a term of art for data science and machine learning which refers to pre-processing and transforming raw data to distill it into a form which is more easily used by machine learning algorithms.  Much like chemical processing can extract pure gold from trace elements within ore, feature engineering can extract value from very noisy data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who has dabbled with any systems-based trading or charting already has experience with simple forms of feature engineering, whether or not they realized it.  For instance:\n",
    "* Converting a series of asset prices into percent change values is a simple form of feature engineering\n",
    "* Charting prices vs. a moving average is an implicit form of feature engineering\n",
    "* Any technical indicator (RSI, MACD, etc...) are also forms of feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The process takes in one or more columns of \"raw\" input data (e.g., OHLC price data, 10-Q financials, social media sentiment, etc...) and converts it into _many_ columns of engineered features.   \n"
   ]

    "## Words of Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is fundamentally a creative process.  As such, I believe there should be a minimum of rules or limits placed on it.  However, I do believe there are a few guidelines to be followed:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __No peeking:__ Peeking (into the future) is the original sin of feature engineering (and prediction modeling in general).  It refers to using information about the future (or information which would not yet be known by us...) to engineer a piece of data.  This can be obvious, like using next_12_months_returns.  \n",
    "\n",
    " However, it's most often quite subtle, like using the mean or standard deviation across the full time period to normalize data points (which implicitly leaks future information into our features.  The test is whether you would be able to get __the exact same value__ if you were calculating the data point at that point in time rather than today. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Only the knowable:__ A corrolary to the above, you also need to be honest about what you would have known at the time, not just what had happened at the time.  For instance, short borrowing data is reported by exchanges with a considerable time lag.  You would want to stamp the feature with the date on which you _would have known_ it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Complete the table:__ Many machine learning algorithms expect that every input feature will have a value (of a certain type) for each observation.  If you envision a spreadsheet where each feature is a column and each observation is a row, there should be a value in each cell of the table.  Quite often, some features in the table will naturally update themselves more frequently than others.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Price data updates almost continuously, while short inventory, analyst estimates, or EBITDA tend to update every few weeks or months.  In these cases, we'll use a scheme like last observation carried forward (LOCF) to always have a value for each feature in the naturally lower frequency columns.  Of course, we will be careful to avoid inadvertent peeking!\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Avoid false ordinality:__ Finally, it's extremely important to represent features in a way that captures ordinality only if it has meaning.  For instance, it's usually a bad idea to represent \"day of the week\" as an integer 1 to 7 since this implicitly tells the model to treat Friday as very similar to Thursday, but \"a little more\".  It would also say that Sunday and Monday are totally different (if Sunday =7 and Monday =1). We could miss all manner of interesting patterns in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "I will begin by extracting some toy data into a dataframe using free data from [quandl](https://www.quandl.com/): \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll make a utility function which downloads one or more symbols from quandl and returns the adjusted OHLC data (I generally find adjusted data to be best)."

    "Another interesting application of this same pattern is to rank each stock _cross-sectionally_ rather than _longitudinally_ as above.  In other words, where does this stock rank within all of the stocks on that day, not for all prior days of that stock.  The below example isn't very meaningful with only two stocks, but quite useful when using a realistic universe.  In this example, we're also making use of an earlier feature (relative volume) to compare which symbol is most heavily traded _for that stock's normal range_ in a given day.  Also note that we need to `dropna()` prior to ranking because `rank` doesn't handle nulls very gracefully.   "
