This post will build on the framework and philosophy presented there.  \n",

    "This post is going to delve into the mechanics of _walk-forward modeling_ which is, in my view, the most robust way to train and apply machine learning models in inherently sequential domains like finance.

    "The domain of market prediction presents several unique challenges for machine learning practitioners which do not exist in spam detection, natural language processing, image recognition, or other common areas of machine learning success, including:\n",
    "* Low signal-to-noise ratio\n",
    "* Non-stationarity (aka regime switching)\n",
    "* Market adaptation (aka reflexivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these challenges make it difficult to train and tune models which _generalize_ to the future, where it really matters.  This, in my view, has led many to conclude that markets cannot be predicted with machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a flawed conclusion.  Instead, we should conclude that it's imperative to follow a modeling process which (1) avoids the trap of overfitting models to noise, (2) takes into account the sequential dimension of time series data, and (3) allows us to get an accurate view about how various models would have performed in the past _given the information we would have had at that time_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But wait!\" I hear you saying, \"Overfitting is not unique to market prediction!\".  True, but the commonly used techniques of _train-test split_ and _cross-validation_ each have major flaws when applied to an inherently sequential set of financial time series data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The overriding objective of the methods described here is to __overcome the issues inherent in traditional cross validation approachs__.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with typical approaches\n",
    "__Train-Test Split:__  One frequently recommended approach in finance ML tutorials is to split the data (commonly, by time) and to train on the first chunk of data and test out-of-sample on the second.  This is not wrong per se, but creates two problems:\n",
    "1. Only a fraction of data can be used to generate out-of-sample performance of the model.  If you split 80/20, then you only get results for 2 of every 10 years of data.  Yuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You're implicitly biased towards the most recent period.  Since we're likely going to use the older data to train and newer data to test (for good reason...) you are implicitly searching for a model which was in favor during the most recent couple of years.  Maybe last year is a good approximation for next year, but maybe it's not.  Maybe 2008 would hold some important lessons for us to evaluate, but these would be lost to us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might consider train/test split with random (or non-random) sampling but this creates other fairly obvious issues with peeking into the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Cross Validation:__  In normal ML usage, cross-validation methods, such as the [K-fold cross validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html), provide an elegant way to have our digital cake and eat it too.  However, with inherently sequential datasets, it's really not kosher to train a model on 2016 and 2018 to predict 2017.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another common method, [leave one out cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut.html#sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut), creates even more extreme peeking into the future.  _These issues are especially intolerable if your model predicts values multiple bars in the future_, which results in your models being trained on data which significantly overlaps with your test data - a subtle but deadly form of data spillover."

    "### The Solution: Walk-forward Train/Test\n",
    "But we are not stuck with either of these problematic approaches.  The better - and I think much more intuitive - approach is to simulate models in a \"walk-forward\" sequence, periodically re-training the model to incorporate all data available at that point in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The below picture is worth at least 1000 words.  Say we have six years of data to train + test.  At the end of the first year (T=1) we could have built model M1, which was trained on the first year's data (the grey bar).  After the 5th year, we could use up to five years of data to train model M5.  \n",

    "\n",
    "First, we create two arrays, `begin_dates` and `end_dates`, which contain the dates on which each model is used.  For instance, for the first model (i=0), we will apply this model to features beginning on the date we trained the model (`recalc_date`) until the day the next model is trained.  The `end_dates` array therefore drops the 0th element and appends to the end a far-off date (in the year 2099).  \n",

    "* This approach gives us a more realistic view of how effective our model would truly have been in the past, and helps to avoid the overfitting trap.\n",
