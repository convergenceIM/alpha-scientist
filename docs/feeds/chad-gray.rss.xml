This technique focuses on improving out-of-sample generalization of models, making it extremely well suited to messy, non-stationary, regime shifting markets.  Like the prior five parts of the series, this presents a practical framework for applying ML to real-world financial time series prediction problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 07:31:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2019-02-14:/ensemble_modeling.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>modeling</category></item><item><title>Towards Better Keras Modeling</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/hyperparameter_optimization_with_talos.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If deep learning is part art and part science, one of the more "artistic" aspects must be model topology design.  Deep learning books and courses are generally vague on the subject.  Practitioners are often forced to resort to tedious trial and error.  In this post, I'll walk through &lt;code&gt;talos&lt;/code&gt;, a package which aims to automate the process of hyperparameter optimization for keras models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:03:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2019-02-08:/hyperparameter_optimization_with_talos.html</guid><category>modeling</category><category>keras</category></item><item><title>Swimming Against the Current</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/october_flows.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;October 2018 has started with a frenzy of activity in the markets.  This post explores which way the funds have been flowing in October so far.

This post is going to delve into the mechanics of feature selection - a critical step towards improving model robustness. This will cover a systematic approach for choosing between the many variations of features you've created during the feature engineering stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-12:/feature_selection.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>feature engineering</category></item><item><title>Stock Prediction with ML: Feature Engineering</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/feature_engineering.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post is going to delve into the mechanics of feature engineering for the sorts of time series data that you may use as part of a stock price prediction modeling system.

Perhaps not the most electrifying of topics, but it's the foundation for later modeling tutorials. It's also of critical significance and importance. I've heard it said that 90% of time in real-world quant finance is spent on data rather than models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 20:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-07-05:/data_management.html</guid><category>tutorial</category><category>data</category><category>pandas</category></item><item><title>Our Own Worst Enemy</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/investor_flows.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We've all had the feeling - buying or selling at the worst possible time.  Rest assured, you're not alone.  The average investor significantly underperforms the market indices because the market consistently lures them into buying high and selling low.  This post delves into the data and finds that typical ETF investors underperform the funds they use by 1 to 4% per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chad Gray</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2018 20:03:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:alphascientist.com,2018-06-21:/investor_flows.html</guid><category>ETFs</category><category>market anomaly</category></item><item><title>Sell in May and Go Away?</title><link>https://alphascientist.com/sell_in_may.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There's an old wall street axiom which advises to "sell in May and go away".
